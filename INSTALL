To build and install Emulika:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ sudo make install


=> Raspberry Pi
	Build SDL2 without the X11 support or execute it in a non X11 environment.
		$ ./configure --disable-video-x11

=> Windows (MinGW32)
	Try to build SDL2 with full DirectX support -> http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/mingw32/README.txt
	And build your own version of libxml2 library because the included version with MinGW32 crashes.
