=============

Emulika is another emulator for the Sega Master System and Game Gear console.

Emulika does not aim to be different from others emulators, it was written just for fun and also probably with a little of nostalgia.

Emulika is written in C and uses the SDL2 library for rendering.

Emulika running on Linux (little endian), Raspberry Pi and Windows (MinGW32/Cygwin).

Emulika supports the following features :
	- zipped ROM
	- windowed mode / fullscreen
	- keyboard / joysticks
	- screenshots
	- snapshots
	- and ... 100% command line :)

./emulika --help for more options.
