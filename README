=============

Emulika is another emulator for the Sega Master System console.

Emulika does not aim to be different from others emulators, it was written just for fun and also probably with a little of nostalgia.

Emulika is written in C and uses the SDL2 library for rendering.

Emulika running on Linux (little endian), Raspberry Pi and Windows (MinGW32/Cygwin).

Emulika supports the following features :
	- zipped ROM
	- windowed mode / fullscreen
	- keyboard / joysticks
	- screenshots
	- snapshots
	- and ... 100% command line :)

./emulika --help for more options.
